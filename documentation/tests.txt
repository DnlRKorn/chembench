Here's a list of tests that Chembench needs to pass every time we put out a production build.

======================
 I. DATASETS / APPLET
======================
1. Create a continuous dataset (modeling)
2. Create a category dataset (modeling)
3. Create a prediction dataset 
4. View the results of each of the dataset sketch generation jobs. Verify that the sketches are present on the applet.
5. Check that the new modeling datasets are available on modeling page.
6. Check that the new modeling and prediction datasets are available on the prediction page.
7. Create Tanimoto and Mahalanobis distances for each of the new datasets.
8. Create heatmap, tree, and PCA visualization plots for each dataset.
9. Look at all the outputs of (7) and (8) in the applet.

==============
 II. MODELING
==============

1. Make a continuous model and a category from the all-user datasets. Use parameters that avoid getting "No models generated".
2. Make models using the two modeling sets created in (I). 
3. Test modeling with all the different descriptor generation methods. (Can be combined with tests 1 and 2.)
4. Check that y-Randomization and external validation chart work.
5. Check that 3D structure viewing works.
6. Save the models and download them.

=========================
 III. PREDICTION / QUEUE
=========================

1. Make SMILES predictions using the 4 models (above). Check that drawn structures work.
2. Run prediction jobs for each model, using high cutoff to force some predicted values to come out. 
3. Run a prediction using the predictor's modeling dataset and check the results. The predicted values should be near the .act file values.
4. Start some extra prediction jobs and cancel them before they run. Let at least one job run after a canceled job.
5. Start prediction jobs from different users and cancel them, too. Really mess with the queue and try to break it.

===================
 IV. USERS / ADMIN
===================

1. Set the User Acceptance mode to "Automatic".
2. Make a new user.
3. Make some models or predictions or datasets as the new user.
4. Delete the new user. Verify that their filesystem junk gets deleted.
5. Set the User Acceptance mode to "Manual".
6. Make two new users. Approve one and deny the other.
7. Run two huge modeling jobs as the approved user (so it hits the modeling limit).
8. Approve one modeling task and deny the other.
9. Change the user's password.
10. Test the "Forgot Password" page (comes up when you fail at password-remembering.)
